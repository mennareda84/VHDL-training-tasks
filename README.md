# VHDL-training-tasks
This repository contains my training tasks at NTI, including code implementations, testbenches, and waveform results.  

The tasks cover both **combinational** and **sequential** circuit designs, focusing on building, testing, and analyzing digital systems using **VHDL**.  

All designs were created and simulated using **Xilinx Vivado**.

## Task Structure

- `src/` → VHDL source codes for each task  
- `testbench/` → Testbenches used to verify functionality  
- `waveform/` → Simulation results from Vivado  
- Additional materials such as truth tables, state diagrams, and schematics
